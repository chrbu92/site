# Leadership Is What You Do, Not What You Tell Others

I've been thinking about this quote from Donald McGannon lately: "Leadership is an action, not a position." It perfectly captures something I've observed throughout my career — the best teams I've worked with weren't necessarily led by the person with "Manager" in their title. They were driven by individuals who saw problems and fixed them, who helped their teammates succeed, and who weren't afraid to speak up when something needed to change.

The truth is, real leadership happens at every level of an organization. It's the senior engineer who takes time to walk a junior developer through a complex debugging session. It's the product manager who organizes cross-team alignment meetings when communication starts breaking down. It's the designer who creates a shared component library because they noticed everyone was reinventing the same UI patterns.

These aren't management activities — they're leadership activities. And the teams that figure this out first are the ones that consistently outperform their peers.

## Servant Leadership Without the Title

What I'm really advocating for is servant leadership, but not in the way most people think about it. Traditional servant leadership focuses on managers putting their teams first. That's great, but it shouldn't stop there. The most effective teams are full of servant leaders — people who prioritize the team's success above their own individual contributions.

This looks different depending on your role, but the principle is the same: see a problem, fix it. If it's beyond your individual ability to fix, drive for systemic solutions. Get leadership buy-in, organize meetings, create documentation, improve processes for others. Be generous with your time and knowledge.

I've seen individual contributors transform their teams by taking ownership of problems that weren't technically "their job." They didn't wait for permission or a promotion — they just started leading.

The key distinction between being helpful and actually leading is proactivity. Everyone helps when directly asked. Leaders identify opportunities to help before being asked. They volunteer opinions even when the room is quiet, but they do it in a way that invites collaboration and opposing viewpoints rather than shutting down discussion.

## The Hierarchy Challenge

Now, I know what some of you are thinking: "That's great in theory, but what about when speaking up could hurt my career?" This is a legitimate concern, especially in hierarchical organizations where challenging the status quo can have consequences.

But here's the thing — I'm not advocating for reckless insubordination. Most of the leadership behaviors I'm describing happen within your immediate team context. You're not trying to restructure the entire organization; you're making your team more effective.

And yes, sometimes leading from your position does mean speaking truth to power. Hierarchical leaders can only be effective when they're properly informed, and some of that information has to come from the team they lead. The goal isn't to be confrontational — it's to be constructively honest about what's working and what isn't.

The teams I've seen succeed at this develop a culture where these conversations feel natural rather than risky. Which brings me to how different audiences can support this approach.

## For Individual Contributors: Lead From Where You Are

If you're an IC, you already have more leadership opportunities than you might realize. Start by looking for small problems you can solve without asking permission. Improve documentation that's confusing. Create team resources that make everyone more effective. Share knowledge proactively rather than waiting for people to ask.

When you see systemic issues, don't just complain about them — propose solutions. You don't need approval to draft a document outlining the problem and potential fixes. You just need approval to implement the solution, and you're much more likely to get that when you've done the thinking work upfront.

## For Managers: Recognize and Amplify

If you're in management, your job is to create an environment where this kind of leadership can flourish. Recognize and reward collaborative behaviors, not just individual achievements. When someone on your team helps others succeed or drives process improvements, make that visible to the broader organization.

Build promotion criteria that explicitly includes evidence of helping teammates grow. Create dedicated time for knowledge sharing and process improvement. Most importantly, trust your team to make good decisions and explain them to you afterward rather than requiring approval for every action.

## For Organizations: Build Leadership Density

Organizations that want to foster this culture need to think systematically about it. Implement recognition systems that reward collaborative leadership behaviors. Create psychological safety initiatives that make it safe to speak up and propose changes. Give teams resources and time to actually improve how they work.

Consider peer nomination awards, "multiplier" bonuses for people who elevate others, or innovation time where anyone can propose solutions to problems they've identified. The goal is to build what I think of as "leadership density" — teams where leadership capability is distributed rather than concentrated in a few formal positions.

## The Scalability Advantage

Here's why this approach actually makes business sense: it creates more resilient organizations. When leadership capability is distributed throughout your teams, you can adapt faster to changing circumstances. You're not crippled when a single leader leaves, and you have a built-in pipeline of people who've learned to lead by doing rather than by taking courses.

Teams composed of leaders at the IC level consistently arrive at better decisions because they've been thinking like owners all along. Over time, these teams and their managers develop trusting, reliable relationships that make the entire organization more efficient.

## The Trust Evolution

The most successful teams I've worked with have evolved from "ask permission" to "explain decisions." This doesn't happen overnight — it requires consistent demonstration of good judgment and alignment with organizational goals. But when it works, it's a massive efficiency gain for everyone involved.

The key is avoiding decision paralysis when multiple people are trying to lead. This is where having shared principles and clear communication becomes essential. Teams need to develop norms about who leads what types of decisions and how to handle disagreements constructively.

## The Bottom Line

Leadership isn't about your title or your position on the org chart. It's about taking ownership, helping others succeed, and making your team more effective than the sum of its parts. The organizations that figure out how to cultivate this kind of distributed leadership are the ones building the next generation of high-performing teams.

The choice isn't whether you have formal authority — it's whether you're going to use the influence you already have to make things better. That influence might be smaller than a VP's, but it's real, and it matters more than you think.

Start where you are, with what you have. Lead through action, not position. Your team — and your career — will be better for it.
