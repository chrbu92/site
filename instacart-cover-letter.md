Dear Hiring Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Engineering Manager position on Instacart's Enterprise Platform team. The opportunity to lead a team building the APIs and tools that power Instacart's Fulfillment-as-a-Service offering is compelling because it sits at the intersection of what I love most about engineering leadership: building reliable platforms at scale, growing high-performing teams, and solving complex cross-organizational challenges that directly impact customers.

At ForeFlight, I lead an 8-person engineering team responsible for mission-critical aviation applications serving 200K+ monthly active users. Our platform handles real-time flight logging with regulatory compliance reporting for the FAA, EASA, and Transport Canada—systems where reliability isn't optional. I've defined and maintained SLOs for these services, led incident response and blameless postmortems, and implemented comprehensive observability using DataDog for distributed tracing and alerting across our microservices architecture. This operational discipline has been essential to maintaining the trust of pilots who depend on our platform.

Beyond my direct reports, I regularly orchestrate cross-functional initiatives spanning 10+ engineers across Product Management, Mobile Engineering, and peer teams. This experience aligning stakeholders, landing cross-org projects, and driving platform adoption maps directly to what you're looking for in this role.

One area where I believe I can make immediate impact is improving developer velocity through AI. I've led the adoption of LLM-based development tools across our engineering workflows, using them strategically to accelerate delivery while maintaining engineering rigor. I've written extensively about practical AI adoption for engineers, and I see it as one of the highest-leverage investments a platform team can make today. Your job description explicitly calls this out as a preferred qualification—it's something I'm genuinely passionate about and have concrete experience implementing.

What draws me to Instacart specifically is the scale and impact of the Enterprise Platform. Supporting $4B in GTV and enabling retailers to operate their own digital storefronts is the kind of complex, high-stakes platform work I find most energizing. I've spent my career building systems that people rely on—whether that's pilots trusting flight logging software or law enforcement officers depending on clear communication in crisis situations. That sense of building something essential resonates with Instacart's mission.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience building reliable platforms, growing engineering teams, and driving operational excellence could contribute to the Enterprise Platform team's continued growth.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Christian Bulloss
